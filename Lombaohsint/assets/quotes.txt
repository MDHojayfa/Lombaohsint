Legendary things take time. Stay sharp.
The sharpest tools make the cleanest cuts.
The best defense is a good offense... when you're the defender.
Every piece of data you find is a puzzle piece.
They thought they were hidden. They were wrong.
Silence is the loudest scream.
Don't wait for permission. Take it.
The internet remembers. So do we.
Trust nothing. Verify everything.
You don't need a key. You just need to know where to look.
